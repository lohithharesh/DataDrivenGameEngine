This is a project i am worked on as a part of my Programming class at FIEA. I made an entity based engine, Where entities can be anything in the game
like actors in UE4. Custom entities can be added by extending the base entity class and adding other logic to it. These entities can then
be created and configured by making a Json file. The file is then read during runtime and it loads all the thing. It is a simple engine, which
I made mainly to learn C++, OOP and some things about how game engines work under the hood. 
Using this engine as a base, Me and some of my friends made a game called Baba is You. It is a puzzle game. you can find the exe for the game 
at: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RIA9j-aSaua8-VIwJ0L1zoCp813PvDky.

Some Things that I am Did as a part of the engine:

Custom containers (hash map, vector, list) closely matching the STL in terms of functionality and design
Json parser for the user to specify custom objects and functionality easily
Makes use of C++11 features (move semantics, lambda expressions)
Event driven system with actions, reactions and event queues.
A bit of multi threading for the delivering events.
All branches of code unit-tested.
Learn to adapt and use external libraries (glm, json, DirectX).

The Library.Shared folder contains most of the engine related code. Game.Shared contains most of the game logic we wrote. The rendering was
done using DirectX which is in Game.Desktop.Directx. It is a very simple sprite renderer.
